<section class="contents">
<p>In the event of extraordinary circumstances and pursuant to the <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/section-16-academic-information-definitions-and-regulations.html">Academic Regulations</a>, the University may modify the delivery, content, structure, forum, location and/or evaluation scheme. In the event of such extraordinary circumstances, students will be informed of the changes.</p>
<h3>TERRITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</h3>
<p>We acknowledge that Concordia University is located on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien’kehá:ka Nation is recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we gather today. Tiohtiá:ke/Montreal is historically known as a gathering place for many First Nations. Today, it is home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community.</p>
<h3>COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY AND SAFER SPACES</h3>
<p>The Department of Design and Computation Arts is committed to fostering an equitable and positive learning experience for all students, staff and faculty, free from discrimination based for example on race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, religion, ethnicity, age, etc. We value diversity and difference, and strive together to create safer spaces in our classrooms, studios, and labs, where all students can fully engage in scholarly and artistic pursuits, knowing that harmful behaviour (e.g. harassment, microaggressions, intolerance, disrespectful language, etc.) is unacceptable. We believe that celebrating difference is fundamental to supporting an academic community where innovation, creative exploration, and intellectual freedom can flourish.</p>
<h3>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>The course material and outline described here is mostly derived and adapted from the course outline created by Pippin Barr who has taught the course in the past years. Programming isn’t just about knowing the syntax of your chosen programming language. It is not just about knowing that things like <em>if statements, boolean expressions, variables, functions, arrays, operators, looping expressions etc..</em> exist - and need to be used correctly in order to construct a valid program. It is about having an idea - then learning how to <span class = "customP"> translate</span> this idea into a program.</p>
<p>This <span class = "customP"> translation process </span> requires one to break down and organize the idea into smaller parts, components - and then solve/write/implement each part in order to build a whole. The process of having an idea and turning it into a program is not easy nor straightforward. It requires <span class = "customP">time and practice and a plan</span>. Sometimes, one can reuse code from a previous application, or use an API or library.</p>
<p>So, in this course we shift our focus from syntax <em>(CART 253)</em>to considering strategies for building software (translating ideas into programs) - and actively practise the techniques taught and discussed in class. We will also look at more advanced programming constructs: to structure/organize code in different ways, and write more efficient, modular programs. Finally, we will look at other libraries and APIs as a way to extend ones capacities and to open up new avenues for creative expression through code. Students will spend their time practicing to build smaller and larger programs, as well as using a variety of libraries and APIs suited to creative coding while producing and practicing their own original work in a studio environment.</p>
<h3>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h3>
<p>After completing this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidently translate and break down a conceptual/abstract idea into a set of functional programmed parts</li>
<li>Confidently search for, find, and use JavaScript libraries and APIs in their projects</li>
<li>Leverage the power of their programming alongside libraries to create compelling interactive experiences</li>
<li>Discuss and evaluate their creative own coding projects</li>
<li>Provide constructive feedback to others on their coding projects</li>
</ul>
<h3>COURSE OUTLINE</h3>
<p>The curriculum for CART 263 will consist of the following graded components:</p>
<ul>
<li>In class studio tasks</li>
<li>Reading reflections</li>
<li>Participation</li>
<li>Two <em>medium size</em> projects</li>
</ul>
<h4>STRUCTURE</h4>
<p>Class periods will be structured and organized over (4) specific activities: a) technical lectures (live coding): presenting and demonstrating various tools, frameworks and strategies for building smaller and larger programs, b) in class studio work and presentations (collaborative or individual) and c) sessions dedicated to provide students assistance and guidance with assignments and projects</p>
<p>The core technical infrastructure of the course will be built around tutorials and assignments which will, at a minimum, require the use of JavaScript (libraries, frameworks, API's...). Additional workshops may be scheduled throughout the semester based on student needs and the availability of resources. Students are expected to spend around 4 - 8 hours outside of class every week, in order to <span class = "customP">practice</span> taught material as well as <span class = "customP">work on</span> the assigned readings, assignments and projects.</p>

<h4>MORE ON GRADING</h4>
<p>Specific conceptual, technical and aesthetic objectives associated with each individual graded component will be clearly identified and evaluated by the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concept and Originality</li>
<li>Use of Technology</li>
<li>Aesthetics and Form</li>
<li>Critical Thinking</li>
<li>Proper Grammar and Correct Spelling</li>
</ul>
<p>Each student will maintain a <span class = "customP">public Github repository for the course</span>. You can use <a href = "#">the following example repo</a> as a reference :)  All CART 263 students will be required to submit the URL of the repository by the end of the first week. All assignments, reflections and the project must be uploaded and available in this repository throughout the semester. Please note that every student in CART 263 will be able to access and view each others repositories. It is an important aspect and feature in this class to allow students to provide feedback and have access to each others work. Please be respectful at all times and do not copy or borrow another students work without their prior consent.</p>
<h4>REFLECTIONS</h4>
<p>Over the course of the semester <strong>students are expected to write two (2) reflections </strong>. Students should choose two of the artists featured in <a href="https://formandcode.com/links"><span class = "customP">FORM + CODE</span></a> (1 artist per reflection). For each reflection: students need to write one paragraph (greater-than-or equal-to-three-hundred-words) on the artist (who,what,why), and one paragraph(greater-than-or equal-to-three-hundred-words) describing and discussing one of the works by said artist. The reflections need to be in <span class = "customP">PDF</span> format - uploaded to the Student's CART 263 Github repository. Then, the student needs to submit the Github url to the reflection via the corresponding Moodle Assignment Activity. Please see the class schedule for due dates.</p>
<h4>IN-CLASS TASKS</h4>
<p>Over the course of the course of the semester, starting from week two, students will be assigned <span class = "customP">in-class tasks</span>, to be completed usually in teams-of-two. Each task will need to be completed usually within the class session. <strong> It is important and required to do the work in the allocated class time, and marks may be lost otherwise</strong>. Both the instructor and TA will be available during the allocated studio sessions to assist students in the required tasks. All students (not each team) will upload and link the completed task to their <em> CART 263</em> repository as well as supplying the url to the tasks via the corresponding Moodle Assignment Activity. These tasks will cover topics discussed &amp; demonstrated in class. Any given task will have the evaluation criteria stated in its description and will be worth 4%.</p>
<h4>PROJECT I &amp; II</h4>
<ul>
<li><span class = "customP">PROJECT I</span><br>The brief for this project will be available during the week of Jan 19 2026. It will be worth 20% of the final grade and can be worked on in teams of one-or-two Each team will need to present their project in class (in the form of a play test) in the week of February 16th.</li>
<li><span class = "customP">PROJECT II</span><br>The brief for this project will be available during the week of March 9th. It will be worth 24% of the final grade and can be worked on in teams of one-or-two Each team will need to present their project in class (in the form of a play test) in the last week of class.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
