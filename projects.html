<p>The semester will include 2 team projects. These projects will be interactive web applications (game or otherwise) developed in javascript, and they should demonstrate the use of the skills and techniques learned in class. Team size should be two or three people
</p>
<br>

<p>The projects are not simple programming exercises, they should also creatively engage with the topics covered in the <a href  = "readings.html">reading list</a>, and express a thesis or point of view relating to them.
</p>
<br>

<p>Each project will be submitted as:
</p>
    <h4>A link to the completed web application.
    </h4>
<ul>
    <li>For Project 1, the application should make use of javascript to interact with the DOM.
    </li>
    <li>For Project 2, the application should use libraries such as Phaser, Three.js, or similar libraries that we didn’t see in class. (Check with the instructor if you’re not sure about a library)
    </li>
</ul>

    <h4>A link to a GitHub repository used to develop the project.
    </h4>
<ul>
    <li>The repository should demonstrate your progress by showing regular and continuous commits to the code leading up to the final submission.
    </li>
    <li>This means that you should not upload your code all at once, and that you should start using Github right away!
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>An artists’ statement.</h4>
<ul>
<li>This statement is your team’s opportunity to explain your work. It is a critical part of the project and is essential for demonstrating your understanding of the course material.
</li>
<li>The artists’ statement should describe what you’re trying to achieve with your project, and how it engages with the topics seen in the readings.
</li>
<li>Briefly describe your process. What was your initial idea and how did it change? What was the most significant challenge you faced?
</li>
<li>The statement should be around 1300 to 1700 words, and cite at least 2 texts from the <a href  = "readings.html">reading list</a> + 2 texts relating to the topic from your own research. (You may use any citation style, as long as the referenced material can easily be looked up by a reader.)
</li>
<li>It should be submitted as a single PDF document, including the URL of your project and the names and IDs of your team members.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>A class presentation to your fellow students</h4>
<ul>
<li>This will take place at your desks during lab time.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Both projects should be of similar scope. It is your choice if you wish to stay in the same group for both projects or not, or if you wish for the second project to be a continuation or expansion of the first one.</p>
