<li><h3>CREATING AND ANIMATING OBJECTS AND MAKING THEM INTERACTIVE</h3>
This task requires that once again in teams of 3-4 MAX - each team completes <strong>their allocated team's task</strong> : in the code there are <strong>6</strong> different tasks: 
<br>all similar, all using objects and all building upon the Bees and Trees example. 
<br>Each team must implement the code, following the given instructions - so that at the end - <span class = "customP">we have one fully working sketch made up of <strong>all</strong> the parts...</span></li>

<li><h3>PART ONE (COMPLETE PARTS A-F)</h3>
You will be divided up into 6 teams. and each team will complete their task</li>

<li><h3>PART TWO (PRESENT ONE PART OF A-F)</h3>

<h3>SUBMISSION</h3>
<ul>
    <li> SECTION A (TUESDAY): submit to moodle by <span class = "customP"> MONDAY ** 12:00 (MIDDAY)</span> - so that Sabine can merge all the submissions into one file to present for Tuesdays class</li>
    <li> SECTION AA (WEDNESDAY): submit to moodle by <span class = "customP"> TUESDAY ** 12:00 (MIDDAY)</span> - so that Sabine can merge all the submissions into one file to present for Wednesday's class</li>
    <li> SECTION B (THURSDAY): submit to moodle by <span class = "customP"> WEDNESDAY ** 12:00 (MIDDAY)</span> - so that Joachim can merge all the submissions into one file to present for Thursday's class</li>
